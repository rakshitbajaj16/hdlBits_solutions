Problem Statement
We're going to start with a small bit of HDL to get familiar with the interface used by HDLBits. Here's the description of the circuit you need to build for this exercise:

Build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output should always drive 1 (or logic high).


Expected solution length: Around 1 line.

Module Declaration
module top_module( output one );

Hint...
We want to assign 1 to the output one.
