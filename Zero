Build a circuit with no inputs and one output that outputs a constant 0
Now that you've worked through the previous problem, let's see if you can do a simple problem without the hints.

Expected solution length: Around 1 line.

Module Declaration
module top_module(
    output zero
);

Hint...
Fun fact: For Quartus synthesis, not assigning a value to a signal usually results in 0. This problem is actually easier than the previous one.
